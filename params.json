At its core, this is all it does; the real power lies in\r\nall the useful modules that you can install.\r\n\r\nYou write a \"config\", which just means `~/.mjolnir/init.lua`. This\r\nfile, along with whatever modules it requires, have full access to the\r\nbuilt-in `mj` module, and all Lua modules that you have installed.\r\n\r\nDocumentation is coming soon.\r\n\r\n## Try it out\r\n\r\n1. Download [the latest release](https://github.com/mjolnir-io/mjolnir/releases/latest), unzip, right-click `Mjolnir.app`, choose \"Open\"\r\n\r\n2. Install Lua 5.2 into /usr/local e.g. from Homebrew, and then install LuaRocks for Lua 5.2:\r\n\r\n   ~~~bash\r\n   $ brew install homebrew/versions/lua52\r\n   $ brew install luarocks --with-lua52\r\n   $ luarocks install --server=http://rocks.moonscript.org moonrocks\r\n   ~~~\r\n\r\n3. Install some modules from the readme of [mjolnir-core](https://github.com/mjolnir-io/mjolnir-core):\r\n\r\n   ~~~bash\r\n   $ moonrocks install mjolnir-hotkey\r\n   $ moonrocks install mjolnir-application\r\n   ~~~\r\n\r\n   Note: you don't need to install every module, since some of them have lower-level ones as dependencies, e.g. installing mjolnir-hotkey automatically installs mjolnir-keycodes, etc.\r\n\r\n4. Create `~/.mjolnir/init.lua`, and at the top, require the modules you installed, e.g. like this:\r\n\r\n   ~~~lua\r\n   mj.application = require \"mj.application\"\r\n   mj.window = require \"mj.window\"\r\n   mj.hotkey = require \"mj.hotkey\"\r\n   mj.fnutils = require \"mj.fnutils\"\r\n   ~~~\r\n\r\n5. Start writing some fun stuff!\r\n\r\n   ~~~lua\r\n   mj.hotkey.bind({\"cmd\", \"alt\", \"ctrl\"}, \"D\", function()\r\n      local win = mj.window.focusedwindow()\r\n      local f = win:frame()\r\n      f.x = f.x + 10\r\n      win:setframe(f)\r\n   end)\r\n   ~~~\r\n\r\n## Useful modules\r\n\r\nThe [mjolnir-core](https://github.com/mjolnir-io/mjolnir-core) modules\r\ncontain functionality for binding global hotkeys, and inspecting and\r\nmanipulating windows, applications, and screens. They also have\r\ngenerally useful functional programming and geometry functions.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nMjolnir and mjolnir-core use [Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash) for\r\ndocumentation. You can install the Mjolnir docset from inside Dash,\r\nunder Preferences -> Downloads -> User Contributed. Then, type\r\n`mjolnir:` to limit your search scope to Mjolnir functions.\r\n\r\n## Principles\r\n\r\nDevelopment of Mjolnir.app and the mjolnir-core modules follow these\r\nprinciples:\r\n\r\n1. They must be stable. The app should never crash. You should only\r\n   ever have to launch it once, and it should stay running until you\r\n   quit. Period.\r\n\r\n2. They must be lightweight. They should never do anything that drains\r\n   your computer's battery. They should never poll for anything. They\r\n   should use as little RAM as possible. Everything they do should\r\n   feel instant and snappy, never sluggish or delayed.\r\n\r\n3. They should be completely transparent. There should be no surprises\r\n   in how it's behaving, or what's being executed and when. Everything\r\n   should be fully predictable.\r\n\r\n4. They must not be bloated. The app and core modules must always\r\n   adhere to the minimalist philosophy, no excuses. Everything else\r\n   can be a separate Lua module.\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n\r\n1. **How is Mjolnir related to Hydra, Phoenix, or Zephyros?**\r\n\r\n   The short of it is, Mjolnir is the successor to these older apps. Or check out [the full story](http://sdegutis.github.io/2014/08/11/the-history-and-current-state-of-appgrid-zephyros-phoenix-hydra-penknife-and-mjolnir/).\r\n\r\n3. **How does Mjolnir compare to Slate?**\r\n\r\n   They're both programmer-centric with mostly similar goals but very\r\n   different approaches. Try them both and see which one suits you\r\n   better.\r\n\r\n4. **How does Mjolnir compare to Spectacle, Moom, SizeUp, Divvy, etc?**\r\n\r\n   Mjolnir is intended for programmers who want to write programs that\r\n   customize their environment. It's not intended to be a drag-n-drop\r\n   solution; it's meant to allow you to write your own personalized\r\n   productivity enhancement suite to keep and use long-term.\r\n\r\n## Community\r\n\r\nOur [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mjolnir-io)\r\nis a fine place to share ideas, and follow releases and announcements.\r\n\r\nWe also have a growing IRC channel on freenode, #mjolnir.\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nMjolnir is developed by Steven Degutis with the help of\r\n[various contributors](https://github.com/mjolnir-io/mjolnir/graphs/contributors).\r\n\r\nSee the About-panel in the app for other credits including open source\r\nsoftware Mjolnir uses.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n### 0.3\r\n\r\n- The UI has changed drastically. Expect nothing to be in the same\r\n  place or look the same. Pretend it's a brand new app.\r\n- Modules are now handled by LuaRocks instead of by the app itself.\r\n- The \"core\" namespace has been renamed to \"mj\".\r\n- The 'mj.window' module now ships with the 'mj.application' LuaRocks\r\n  package since they depend on each other.\r\n- `mj.screen:frame_without_dock_or_menu()` is now called `mj.screen:frame()`\r\n- `mj.screen:frame_including_dock_and_menu()` is now called `mj.screen:fullframe()`\r\n\r\n### 0.2\r\n\r\n- Did anyone actually use this?\r\n\r\n### 0.1\r\n\r\n- First public release\r\n\r\n## Donate\r\n\r\nI've worked hard to make this app useful and easy to use. I've also\r\nreleased it with a liberal open source license, so that you can do\r\nwith it as you please.\r\n\r\nSo, instead of charging for licenses, I'm asking for donations. If you\r\nfind Mjolnir genuinely beneficial to your productivity, I encourage\r\nyou to donate what you believe is fair.\r\n\r\nYour donations will fund the time I'll be spending making Mjolnir even\r\nbetter, and will be used to compensate volunteers for the time and\r\nskills which they have generously contributed to the project.\r\n\r\nCurrently, donations can be made [by PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?business=sbdegutis@gmail.com&cmd=_donations&item_name=Mjolnir.app%20donation&no_shipping=1) or [with a credit card](https://sites.fastspring.com/sdegutis/instant/hydra).\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n> Released under MIT license.\r\n>\r\n> Copyright (c) 2013 Steven Degutis\r\n>\r\n> Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\n> of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\n> in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\n> to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\n> copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\n> furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n>\r\n> The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\n> all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n>\r\n> THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\n> IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\n> FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
